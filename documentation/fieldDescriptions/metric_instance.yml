id: |
  The ObjectId of the MetricInstance.
slug: |
  A string that uniquely identifies this MetricInstance by referencing the
  definition slug and MetricProvider ObjectId.
definition_slug: |
  A descriptive string that identifies the metric definition this instance
  derives from (e.g. `http.tcp_connection_time`, `apdex`, etc.).
enabled: |
  Whether or not to show this metric on the Component that uses it (through
  the Watchdog).
top_level_enabled: |
  Whether or not to show this metric on the status page home.
title: |
  The title of the metric, displayed above its graph on the status page.
x_title: |
  The title of the x-axis of this metric.
y_title: |
  The title of the y-axis of this metric.
x_type: |
  The type of quantity represented by the x-axis.
y_type: |
  The type of quantity represented by the y-axis.
y_supremum: |
  The least upper bound to display the y-axis on. The metric will always display
  up to at least this value on the y-axis regardless of the graphed data. If the
  graph exceeds this value, then the bound will be raised as much as necessary
  to accommodate the data.
plot_type: |
  The kind of visualization to display the metric with.
interpolation: |
  The kind of interpolation to use between points displayed in the graph (line
  plots only).
aggregation: |
  The kind of aggregation method to use in case multiple displayed data points
  share the same time-axis value (depending on the axis configured for time, by
  default x). **Note:** this field does not have any effect on the underlying
  data; it is purely cosmetic, and applied only when viewing the data on the
  status page.
