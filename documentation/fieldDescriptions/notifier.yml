id: |
  The ObjectId of this Notifier.
created_at: |
  The UNIX timestamp at which this Notifier was created.
updated_at: |
  The UNIX timestamp at which this Notifier was last updated.
channel: |
  Defines the channel used by this Notifier to deliver notifications. Typically,
  this sets the type as well as relevant credentials for the channel (e.g. SMTP
  server details, API credentials, etc.).
enabled: |
  Whether this Notifier is currently enabled. Disabled notifiers do not deliver
  notifications to endpoints until enabled again.
curated: |
  Whether this Notifier is curated. When true, disables public subscriptions on
  this Notifier. Thus, Subscriptions for this Notifier may only be created from
  the dashboard or API.
subscribable: |
  Whether this Notifier channel can have individual Subscriptions. When false,
  this Notifier cannot create Subscriptions, and broadcasts to a single endpoint
  configured in `channel`.
include_group_in_component_names: |
  For certain Notifier channels (i.e. `email`, `slack`), instructs templates to
  render Component names with their Group name as well (e.g. `Group 1 / Component 1`).
listens_to: |
  A list of notification events that this Notifier will either listen for (when
  `subscribable` is false), or set as the Subscription `listens_to` default (when
  `subscribable` is true).

  To read more about the various notification event types encountered within Hund,
  please [read this article](https://hund.io/help/documentation/notifications).
listens_to_level: |
  A string representation of the `listens_to` array, when it matches a specific
  preset. This field can also be used to set `listens_to` according to a preset
  in forms.

  * `all`: listen to all event types.
  * `normal`: listen to most event types, except for generic `issue_updated`
  (listens only for `issue_resolved` instead)
  * `custom`: the current `listens_to` array does not match one of the above
  presets
notification_exclusions: |
  A list of Component ObjectIds that this Notifier will either ignore notifications
  regarding (when `subscribable` is false), or set as the Subscription
  `notification_exclusions` default (when `subscribable` is true).

  A specific notification is suppressed exactly when all of the Event's
  `component` context is excluded by this list. If any of an Event's `component`
  context remains unexcluded by the Subscription, then a notification will be sent.
locale: |
  The language in which to render notifications sent by this Notifier. The
  string should be a supported [IETF BCP 47 language tag](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.html)
  (e.g. `en`, `de`, `pt-BR`, etc.).

  When this field is `null`, the default language of the Status Page will be used
  when rendering notifications.

  **Note:** Use this field to set the language of Notifiers like `twitter`. For
  most channels, this field *will not be used*, particularly when the Notifier
  supports Subscriptions.
