sender_address: |
  The Email address to set in the `From` Email header.
sender_display_name: |
  The display name to show alongside the `sender_address` (e.g. `Display Name <user@example.com>`).
smtp_hostname: |
  The hostname of the SMTP server.
smtp_port: |
  The port of the SMTP server.

  **Note:** *do not* attempt to use port 25 in this field. This port number is
  blocked by our datacenter, and thus we are unable to deliver Emails over port 25.
smtp_user: |
  The username to use when authenticating with the SMTP server.
smtp_password: |
  The password to use when authenticating with the SMTP server.
smtp_authentication: |
  The authentication strategy to use when authenticating with the SMTP server.
  The correct value of this field depends entirely on your particular SMTP server.
smtp_domain: |
  An optional HELO domain to send when connecting to the SMTP server.
domain_whitelist: |
  Limits the emails that may subscribe to this Notifier by their domain,
  according to the whitelisted values in this field. The list supports an
  asterisk character as a wildcard in place of a subdomain.

  For example, `*.hund.io` will allow all subdomains under `hund.io`. It will
  not allow `hund.io` itself, however; `hund.io` would need to be entered as a
  seperate listing. Furthermore, it wouldnâ€™t allow `example.example.hund.io`,
  as that would require yet another listing: `*.*.hund.io`.
