level: |
  The current access level for this Permission. The possible levels are:

  * `n`: No Access
  * `r`: Read-only Access
  * `w`: Read/Write Access

  **Note:** Certain resource types (e.g. `component`, `group`, `issue`, etc.)
  are considered to be "publicly readable" (in the sense that those objects can
  be read from the status page itself) and thus will not be able to take on the
  `n` access level. Instead, `r` will be the lowest possible access level for
  those resource types.
modifiers: |
  An array of string modifiers that may augment the behavior of the Permission.
  Available modifiers are specific to the resource type.
