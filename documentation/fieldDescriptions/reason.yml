id: |
  The ObjectId of this Reason.
region: |
  When non-null, describes the physical region (e.g. `nj-us-1`, `fr-de-1`, etc.)
  that this Reason occurred from.
began_at: |
  The UNIX timestamp at which this reason began causing the related sub-operational
  Status.
ended_at: |
  The UNIX timestamp at which this reason finally ceased causing the related
  sub-operational Status.

  This field is `null` when this Reason is currently responsible for an ongoing
  sub-operational Status.
fingerprint: |
  A unique hash identifying the `subject`/`description`/`context` combination
  that fully describes this Reason. Fingerprints between Reasons will be equal
  if and only if the `subject`, `description`, and `context` fields are all equal,
  hence representing the *same error* (regardless of regional/temporal fields).
subject: |
  The specific "subject" of this error, typically a URL, domain name, or IP
  address.
description: |
  A machine-friendly, human-readable description of the error. To maintain
  machine-friendliness, this field will always be a underscore-delimited
  alphanumeric word (e.g. `timeout`, `response_body_invalid`,
  `response_records_invalid`, etc.).
context: |
  A list of string terms that further describe the nature of the error, depending
  on `description`. Typically, this field will be filled with terms related to a
  failed assertion: with the actual value first (if recordable), then the
  expectation after that, potentially followed by further `description`-specific
  terms.

  For example, given a `description` of `response_code_invalid`, then the
  `context` field will look like `["500", "200"]`, meaning an HTTP response code
  of 500 was returned from `subject`, while code 200 was expected by the Watchdog.
status: |
  The Status that this Reason is (wholly or partially) responsible for causing.
watchdog: |
  The Watchdog that this Reason pertains to.
