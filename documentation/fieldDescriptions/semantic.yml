id: |
  The ObjectId of this Semantic.
created_at: |
  The UNIX timestamp at which this Semantic was created.
updated_at: |
  The UNIX timestamp at which this Semantic was last updated.
slug: |
  An alphanumeric slug that can be used to reference this Semantic in place of
  its `id` (e.g. webhook calls, integrations). Thus, this value must be unique.
name: |
  An I18nString representing the user-facing name of this Semantic.
color: |
  A 6-digit hexadecimal RGB color, used to appropriately color usages of this
  Semantic on your status page.
icon: |
  A string denoting a specific icon that should be shown next to Components on
  your status page when this Semantic occurs. When null, falls back to an
  icon determined by the underlying state of the Component.
severity: |
  An integer that denotes how "severe" this Semantic is. Smaller (including negative)
  values are considered more severe. This field is primarily used to order Semantics,
  and choose a predominant Semantic when a Component is under multiple Semantics
  (e.g. when multiple Issues are active with `semantic_override`s).
historical_grouping: |
  Whether to group events with this Semantic with other events of similar underlying
  state (i.e. suboperational vs. operational) in your status page's historical timeline.
operational_historical_entry: |
  Whether to emit historical entries for events with this semantic, particularly
  when the underlying state is Operational.

  By default, operational states are not recorded explicitly in history, since
  it is assumed that streaks of Operational status are typical and expected, and
  therefore and do not need to be shown as events in history.
default_state: |
  The default underlying state that this Semantic implies in cases when a state
  is **not supplied** in conjunction with the Semantic (e.g. a Webhook watchdog).

  **Note:** This field has **no effect** on Components where the underlying state
  is already determined, and thus the Semantic would merely rename/recolor that
  state, whether ongoing or historical.
status_page_heading: |
  An I18nString representing the description of this Semantic when shown in the
  "Status Bar" of your status page, or the page of a specific Component (e.g.
  "Operating Normally", "Experiencing Downtime", etc.).
historical_entry_heading: |
  An I18nString representing the `title` of a TimelineItem where this Semantic
  occurred. This string is also shown in heading of the historical entry
  on your status page's History section (e.g. "Degraded Service", "Outage", etc.).
notification_description: |
  An I18nString representing the description of the Semantic in notifications when
  it occurs. This string will appear in the notifications from various Notifiers,
  including Emails, Slack, MS Teams, Web Push, and SMS (e.g. "is degraded",
  "has gone down" for Degraded and Outage states, respectively; and "has come
  back up" when entering Operational from a suboperational state).
