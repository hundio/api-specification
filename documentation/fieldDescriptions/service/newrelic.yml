api_key: |
  The New Relic API key.
api_region: |
  The API region to access.
suppress_warning_violations: |
  When `true`, suppresses all warning violations from New Relic Alerts.
suppress_future_issues: |
  When `true`, suppresses newly triggered violations from Alerts when a New
  Relic issue is already ongoing for the policy.
issue_templates: |
  An object of IssueTemplate IDs to create Issues/Updates whenever this Watchdog
  changes state. This Watchdog will create Issues from the `degraded` template
  for violations with warning severity, and `outage` for those with critical severity.

  When multiple violations are present, the highest severity of the violations will be used.

  Once a Watchdog in degraded/outage finds that there are no longer unresolved
  violations, it will resolve Issues via the `operational` template.

  If any of the given templates are `null`, then the Watchdog will not create
  an Issue/Update in that case.
alert_policies: |
  The specific New Relic Alerts policy IDs to track on this Watchdog.
