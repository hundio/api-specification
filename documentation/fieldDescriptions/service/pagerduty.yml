api_key: |
  The PagerDuty API key.
suppress_future_issues: |
  When `true`, suppresses newly triggered incidents when a PagerDuty issue is
  already ongoing for the component.
issue_templates: |
  An object of IssueTemplate IDs to create Issues/Updates whenever this Watchdog
  changes state. This Watchdog will create Issues from the `degraded` template
  for incidents with low urgency, and `outage` for those with high urgency.

  When multiple incidents are present, the highest urgency of the incidents will be used.

  Once a Watchdog in degraded/outage finds that there are no longer unresolved
  incidents, it will resolve Issues via the `operational` template.

  If any of the given templates are `null`, then the Watchdog will not create
  an Issue/Update in that case.
services: |
  An array of PagerDuty service IDs to track on this Watchdog.
