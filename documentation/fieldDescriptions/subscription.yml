id: |
  The ObjectId of this Subscription.
created_at: |
  The UNIX timestamp at which this Subscription was created.
updated_at: |
  The UNIX timestamp at which this Subscription was last updated.
channel: |
  Defines the channel used by this subscription to receive notifications. Typically,
  this sets the type as well as relevant credentials for the channel (e.g. Email
  address, SMS number, etc.).
notifier: |
  The Notifier that this Subscription receives notifications from.
curated: |
  Whether this Subscription is curated. When true, disables public preference
  changes, requiring any Subscription preferences to be edited via the dashboard
  or API. This can be useful in cases like `email`, for example, when a
  Subscription's address represents an entire mailing list, rather than a single
  individual.

  **Note:** a Subscription must be `curatable` in order to set `curated` true.
curatable: |
  Whether this Subscription channel allows for curation.
remove_links: |
  For certain Notifier channels (i.e. `email`), instructs templates to render
  notifications without *any* links back to the status page. This field requires
  `curated` (and thus `curatable`) to be true.
listens_to: |
  A list of notification events that this Subscription will listen for. Prefixing
  an event name with `-` (e.g. `-issue_reopened`) denotes that the event should
  be explicitly suppressed (useful when including superevents like `issue_updated`
  which implicitly includes events like `issue_reopened`).

  To read more about the various notification event types encountered within Hund,
  please [read this article](https://hund.io/help/documentation/notifications).
listens_to_level: |
  A string representation of the `listens_to` array, when it matches a specific
  preset. This field can also be used to set `listens_to` according to a preset
  in forms.

  * `all`: listen to all event types.
  * `normal`: listen to most event types, except for generic `issue_updated`
  (listens only for `issue_resolved` instead)
  * `custom`: the current `listens_to` array does not match one of the above
  presets
notification_exclusions: |
  A list of Component ObjectIds that this Subscription will ignore notifications
  regarding.

  A specific notification is suppressed exactly when all of the Event's
  `component` context is excluded by this list. If any of an Event's `component`
  context remains unexcluded by the Subscription, then a notification will be sent.
