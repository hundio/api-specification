webhook_url: |
  The Slack Incoming Webhook URL. This can be any URL that consumes Slack-style
  message hooks (e.g. Slack, Mattermost, Discord, etc.).

  **Note:** A Slack Subscription plus the Incoming Webhook can be created together
  (thus automatically filling this field) when using the "Quick Setup" button
  from the Notifier configuration in the dashboard.
channel: |
  The Slack channel that the webhook posts notifications to. In the API, this
  field may be set to any value of your choosing for annotation, especially
  useful if the webhook does not originate from Slack (e.g. Mattermost, Discord, etc.).

  **Note:** This field is automatically filled when using "Quick Setup" via the
  dashboard.
team: |
  The Slack team that the webhook belongs to. In the API, this field may be set
  to any value of your choosing for annotation, especially useful if the webhook
  does not originate from Slack (e.g. Mattermost, Discord, etc.).

  **Note:** This field is automatically filled when using "Quick Setup" via the
  dashboard.
