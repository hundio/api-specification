id: |
  The UUID of this TimelineItem.
components: |
  A PagedArray of Components affected by this TimelineItem.
issue: |
  The particular Issue that spawned this TimelineItem. A `null` value implies
  that the TimelineItem is based purely on Watchdog-generated Statuses.

  If `statuses` is non-empty and `issue` exists, then we say that the `issue` is
  "annotating" (or "overriding" when the issue, or any of its updates, sets
  `state_override`) the listed `statuses`.
statuses: |
  A PagedArray of Statuses (if any) that make up this TimelineItem. Typically,
  this will only contain one Status. However, if multiple sub-operational (i.e.
  degraded/outage) Statuses occurred consecutively, then they will each be
  listed here.
source: |
  The particular Timeline source that this TimelineItem belongs to. This is
  either the ObjectId of a single Component, an array of multiple Component
  ObjectIds, or the string `global` (i.e. the item comes from the global Timeline,
  aggregated from all Component-wise Timelines).
title: |
  The title of this TimelineItem. If `issue` exists, then it is the `title` of
  `issue`.
began_at: |
  The UNIX timestamp at which this TimelineItem began affecting the listed `components`.
ended_at: |
  The UNIX timestamp at which this TimelineItem stopped affecting the listed `components`.
duration: |
  The effective duration of this TimelineItem in seconds. This field is zero
  when `effective` is false.
outage_duration: |
  The outage duration of this TimelineItem in seconds. That is, the amount of
  time for which `components` are considered to be in an "outage" state, thus
  negatively affecting their uptime measurements.

  **Note:** when `source` is `global` (or multiple Components), and the
  Component-wise outage durations of `components` are not all equal, then this
  field is null. In this case, consult the generic `outage_durations` field,
  which breaks down the total outage duration per Component.
outage_durations: |
  The per-Component outage durations of this TimelineItem, each in seconds. The
  keys of this object are Component ObjectIds, one for each Component in
  `components`.

  This field is particularly useful when `source` is `global` (or multiple
  Components) and the outage durations of the affected `components` are not all
  equal (and thus `outage_duration` is null).
excluded: |
  Whether this TimelineItem is excluded from the global Timeline. Excluded items
  can still be pulled from this API, but will not be displayed on status pages.
effective: |
  Whether this TimelineItem affects the listed `components`. Typically, this
  field is true, unless `issue` is a cancelled or informational Issue (neither
  of which can affect their Components).
