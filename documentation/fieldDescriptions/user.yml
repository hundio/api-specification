id: |
  The ObjectId of this User.
created_at: |
  The UNIX timestamp at which this User was created.
updated_at: |
  The UNIX timestamp at which this User was last updated.
email: |
  The email address associated with this User. Notifications sent to this User
  will be delivered to this address.

  **Note:** If this address is changed via the API, the *old* email address will
  be informed of the change.
roles: |
  The Role set granted to this User. All Roles granted to this User will appear
  here, regardless of their scope and the current API context.
permissions: |
  The current Permission set calculated from the User's `roles`, according to the
  current API context. Thus, this field represents the User's Permissions under
  either the global account, or a specific status page, depending on the API that
  this User is retrieved from.
listens_to: |
  A list of notification events that this User will listen for. Prefixing
  an event name with `-` (e.g. `-issue_reopened`) denotes that the event should
  be explicitly suppressed (useful when including superevents like `issue_updated`
  which implicitly includes events like `issue_reopened`).

  To read more about the various notification event types encountered within Hund,
  please [read this article](https://hund.io/help/documentation/notifications).
listens_to_level: |
  A string representation of the `listens_to` array, when it matches a specific
  preset. This field can also be used to set `listens_to` according to a preset
  in forms.

  * `all`: listen to all event types.
  * `normal`: listen to most event types, except for generic `issue_updated`
  (listens only for `issue_resolved` instead)
  * `custom`: the current `listens_to` array does not match one of the above
  presets
notification_exclusions: |
  A list of Component ObjectIds that this User will ignore notifications
  regarding.

  A specific notification is suppressed exactly when all of the Event's
  `component` context is excluded by this list. If any of an Event's `component`
  context remains unexcluded by the User, then a notification will be sent.
locale: |
  The language in which to render notifications sent to this User. The string
  should be a supported [IETF BCP 47 language tag](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.html)
  (e.g. `en`, `de`, `pt-BR`, etc.).

  When this field is `null`, the default language of your Account will be used
  when rendering notifications.
